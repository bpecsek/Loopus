#+TITLE: Loopus - A portable loop optimization framework for Common Lisp

Sometimes, when the full moon rises and foolish programmers declare
(optimize (safety 0)), you can hear the howl of the Loopus, and screams of
source code that is ripped to shreds.

Loopus is a portable loop optimization framework for Common Lisp.  It can
either be used as a building block for a compiler, or directly by
application programmers, via macros.

Right now, Loopus is not as sophisticated as I'd like it to be.  My hope is
that this initial version will motivate others to contribute.  So if you
are in the mood for writing a polyhedral optimization framework, don't
hesitate to contact me :)
